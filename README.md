# Description 
The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about each of the team members. The user is able to input as many team members as they'd like, and (a mix of engineers and interns). When the user has finished building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

AS A manager I WANT to generate a webpage THAT displays my team's basic info SO THAT I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.
